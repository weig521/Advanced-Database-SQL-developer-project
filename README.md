In the crucial competition, banks are trying to absorb as many deposits as they can and loan them out to reliable customers at a higher rate for profit. When trying to absorb deposits, being able to target the right customers instead of promoting bank products to all customers means higher succeed rate and efficiency. This will bring a huge competitive advantage for the bank. In this project, tables are created, values are inserted, and some interesting analysis and visualization are done to research the tele-banking utilizing SQL skills mentioned above.

Original data source UCI bank marketing: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

The bank-full.csv is the original data from UCI. To learn how to convert original string data into numerical/binary data, please check my other Python Data Mining project https://github.com/weig521/Data-Mining-Classification-tele-banking-campain-analysis. These two projects are using the same dataset but focusing on different areas (the other one is data mining classification analysis.) The 'ADB customers.csv' is a processed dataset with numerical/binary data.

jobs.xlsx is an excel document I created with all the 12 different jobs to be imported into SQL table.

The 'ADB project.sql' is the SQL script for the project with comments, 'Database Project.docx' is the project report, and 'Database Project Customer Data for Targeting.pptx' is the PowerPoint document for a brief summary.
